Part 1: Text Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis
The code for the first part of the project is structured in the follwoing way:

Imports: This section contains all the imports that are necessary for the code to run properly. Run this section before running the rest of the sections. This section also includes the necessary cell to connect to you Google Drive, were you must have the necessary data.
Functions: This section contains the functions that are necessary to clean the tweets. All of them are commented in the .ipynb file and explained in detail in the pdf. Run all this section
Load Information: In this section we load the data of the json and the csv files. In the first cell of this section you will observe that we have loaded the data from our drive, so you have to copy and paste files paths. The path to farmers-protest-tweets.json has to be loaded into json_path and the path to tweet_document_ids_map.csv has to be loaded into csv_path. Run all this section after adding your paths.
Clean Tweets: In this section we process the tweets and create the dictionary that we will use in the followimng sections
Exploratory Data Analysis: Here we implement the different analysis that we performed.
The code only has to be run, it doesn't ask for any input. You will see comments on the code with explanations of what is being done.
